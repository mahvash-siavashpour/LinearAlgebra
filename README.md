## LinearAlgebra

There 5 different project here that each cover a different section in the data mining world; from preprocessing and analyzing data to classification, clustering, etc.
## Project List
- [Estimation of Covid19 Cases](https://github.com/mahvash-siavashpour/LinearAlgebra/tree/master/EstimationCOVID19Cases)
- [LU Factorization](https://github.com/mahvash-siavashpour/LinearAlgebra/tree/master/LUFactorization)
- [Matrix Row Reduction](https://github.com/mahvash-siavashpour/LinearAlgebra/tree/master/RowReduction)
- [Vector Spaces](https://github.com/mahvash-siavashpour/LinearAlgebra/tree/master/VectorSpaces)

## Project Description
A series of different linear algebraic sub-projects are implemented in this project. This project was implemented to practice using linear albegra and to implement different algorithms using python. 
 contents:
- 1. Estimating corona virus patients in future using regression and least square solution   
- 2. LU Factprization Method for solving equations 
- 3. Row Reduction Algorthm for solving matrices
- 4. Finding column space, row space, null space and etc for a matrix
